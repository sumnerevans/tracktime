# Python to Go Migration Status

This document tracks the migration progress from the Python implementation of tracktime to Go.

**Branch:** `golang`
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-11
**Overall Completion:** ~75%

---

## Overview

The Go rewrite is located in the root directory alongside the legacy Python implementation (in `tracktime/`). Both implementations currently coexist, with the Go version being actively developed.

### Recent Major Changes

**October 2025 - Code Reorganization (commit 9537306):**
The entire codebase was refactored from a flat structure into a proper Go project layout:
- `tracktime.go` → `cmd/tt/main.go`
- `lib/` → `internal/types/`, `internal/config/`, `internal/timeentry/`
- `commands/` → `internal/commands/`
- `synchroniser/` → `internal/synchroniser/`
- New package: `internal/report/` (split from commands for better organization)

**September-October 2025 - Report Command Implementation:**
The report command received extensive development (10+ commits) and now has functional stdout output:
- Text report generation with all core features
- Statistics calculation and formatting
- Table formatting using rodaine/table library
- All sorting and grain options working
- Stdout formatting needs polish to match Python output exactly
- Export formats (PDF/HTML/RST) remain to be implemented

### Current Project Structure

```
cmd/tt/                     # Main entry point
internal/
  ├── commands/             # Command implementations
  ├── config/               # Configuration loading
  ├── report/               # Report generation (separate from commands)
  ├── synchroniser/         # External service sync
  ├── timeentry/            # Time entry and entry list logic
  └── types/                # Core types (Date, Time, Month, Filename)
tracktime/                  # Legacy Python implementation
```

## Core Library Components

### ✅ Fully Implemented

**Note:** As of commit `9537306`, the codebase was refactored from flat `lib/` and `commands/` directories into a proper `internal/` package structure.

| Component | Location | Description | Status |
|-----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Configuration** | `internal/config/config.go` | YAML config parser for `~/.config/tracktime/tracktimerc` | ✅ Complete |
| **Date Type** | `internal/types/date.go` | Date operations and parsing (full Python parity + weekdays) | ✅ Complete with tests |
| **Time Type** | `internal/types/time.go` | HH:MM time format handling | ✅ Complete with tests |
| **Month Type** | `internal/types/month.go` | Month operations and parsing | ✅ Complete with tests |
| **TimeEntry** | `internal/timeentry/entrylist.go` | Core time entry data structure | ✅ Complete |
| **EntryList** | `internal/timeentry/entrylist.go` | Day file management and CSV I/O | ✅ Complete |
| **Filename** | `internal/types/filename.go` | Path expansion and file handling | ✅ Complete |

**Key Features:**
- CSV reading/writing with atomic saves
- Auto-stop logic for overlapping entries
- Day file path generation (`YEAR/MONTH/DAY` structure)
- Time entry type shortcuts (`gh` → `github`, `gl` → `gitlab`)
- Flexible date parsing matching Python implementation:
  - Full dates: `YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYY/MM/DD`, `YY-MM-DD`, `YY/MM/DD`
  - Partial dates: `MM-DD`, `M-D` (defaults to current year)
  - Day only: `DD`, `D` (defaults to current year and month)
  - Keywords: `today`, `yesterday`

## Commands

### ✅ Fully Implemented

| Command | File | Features | Status |
|---------|------|----------|--------|
| **start** | `internal/commands/start.go` | Start new time entry with optional start time, type, project, customer, task ID | ✅ Complete |
| **stop** | `internal/commands/stop.go` | Stop current entry with optional stop time | ✅ Complete |
| **resume** | `internal/commands/resume.go` | Resume previous entry by index (defaults to last entry) | ✅ Complete |
| **list** | `internal/commands/list.go` | List entries for a date with customer filtering, formatted table output, total time | ✅ Complete |
| **edit** | `internal/commands/edit.go` | Open day file in editor (respects config, `$EDITOR`, `$VISUAL`) | ✅ Complete |

**Default behavior:** Running `tt` without subcommand lists today's entries ✅

### 🚧 Partially Implemented

| Command | File | What Works | What's Missing |
|---------|------|------------|----------------|
| **report** | `internal/commands/report.go` + `internal/report/*.go` | Statistics, aggregation, all date/filter options, basic stdout output | Stdout formatting polish, PDF/HTML/RST export formats, file output |
| **sync** | `internal/commands/sync.go` | Command structure, argument parsing | Full implementation (currently just spawns goroutines) |

#### Report Command Details

**✅ Fully Working:**
- ✅ All date range shortcuts (`--today`, `--yesterday`, `--thisweek`, `--lastweek`, `--thismonth`, `--lastmonth`, `--thisyear`, `--lastyear`)
- ✅ Month/year shorthand (`-m`, `-y`)
- ✅ Positional date range (start/end dates)
- ✅ Customer and project filtering (`-c`, `-p`)
- ✅ Data aggregation: `Customer → Project → TaskID → Description → []*TimeEntry`
- ✅ Statistics calculation (days worked, average time per day/weekday/week)
- ✅ Sort by alphabetical or time-spent, ascending/descending
- ✅ Grain options (task/description level) with smart defaults based on date range
- ✅ Rate and total calculations

**Implemented Files:**
- `internal/report/report.go` - Core report logic and data aggregation
- `internal/report/stdout.go` - Text report generation
- `internal/report/statistics.go` - Statistics calculations
- `internal/report/sorting.go` - Sort logic for customers/projects/tasks

**🚧 Needs Polish:**
- ⚠️ Stdout formatting quality (functional but needs visual improvements)
- ⚠️ Table alignment and spacing
- ⚠️ Match Python output format exactly

**❌ Still Missing:**
- PDF export (Python uses ReportLab)
- HTML export
- RST export
- File output (--outfile flag parsed but not wired up)

**Note:** The report command is **~85% complete**. Core functionality and data aggregation work perfectly. Stdout formatting needs polish to match Python output quality. Export formats remain to be implemented.

#### Sync Command Details

**Current State:**
- Accepts month argument with default "this month"
- Spawns synchroniser goroutines
- Has no blocking/completion logic

**Missing:**
- Actual API calls to external services
- Reading/writing `.synced` files
- Error handling and reporting
- Synchroniser coordination

---

## Synchronisers

### 🚧 Partially Implemented

| Service | File | What Works | What's Missing |
|---------|------|------------|----------------|
| **GitHub** | `internal/synchroniser/github.go` | Task ID formatting, task link generation | API calls, actual sync logic, task description fetching |

**Interface Definition:** `internal/synchroniser/syncroniser.go`

**Implemented Methods:**
- `Init()` - Config loading ✅
- `Name()` - Returns "GitHub" ✅
- `GetFormattedTaskID()` - Formats as `#123` ✅
- `GetTaskLink()` - Generates GitHub issue/PR URL ✅
- `GetTaskDescription()` - Stub (returns empty string) ❌
- `Sync()` - Stub (no-op) ❌

**Missing Synchronisers:**
- GitLab (Python has `tracktime/synchronisers/gitlab.py`)
- Sourcehut (Python has `tracktime/synchronisers/sourcehut.py`)
- Linear (Python has `tracktime/synchronisers/linear.py`)

---

## Python Implementation Features Not Yet in Go

### Commands
- None! All Python commands have Go equivalents (though sync needs completion)

### Synchronisers
- ❌ GitLab synchroniser
- ❌ Sourcehut synchroniser
- ❌ Linear synchroniser

### Report Functionality
- 🚧 Stdout output (functional but needs formatting polish)
- ❌ PDF export (Python uses ReportLab)
- ❌ HTML export
- ❌ RST export

### Sync Functionality
- ❌ `.synced` file reading/writing
- ❌ API integration with external services
- ❌ Time aggregation and submission logic
- ❌ Deduplication (checking what's already synced)

## Testing Status

| Package | Test Coverage | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| `internal/types/time.go` | ✅ Has tests (`internal/types/time_test.go`) | Time parsing and formatting |
| `internal/types/month.go` | ✅ Has tests (`internal/types/month_test.go`) | Month parsing |
| `internal/types/date.go` | ✅ Has tests (`internal/types/date_test.go`) | Date parsing (all formats including weekdays), AddDays, AddMonths |
| `internal/commands/` | ❌ No tests yet | All commands need test coverage |
| `internal/report/` | ❌ No tests yet | Report generation and formatting need tests |
| `internal/timeentry/` | ❌ No tests yet | EntryList operations, CSV I/O need tests |
| `internal/config/` | ❌ No tests yet | Config loading needs tests |
| `internal/synchroniser/` | ❌ No tests yet | Synchroniser logic needs tests |

**Current test status:** All tests in `internal/types` pass. Other packages have no tests yet.

## Migration Priorities

Based on current state and user needs:

1. **High Priority** - Complete report command:
   - 🚧 Polish stdout formatting to match Python output exactly
   - ❌ Implement PDF export (requires library selection and integration)
   - ❌ Implement HTML export
   - ❌ Implement RST export
   - ❌ Wire up --outfile flag to write to files
   - Note: Core functionality works but output formatting needs improvement

2. **Medium Priority** - Testing:
   - Add unit tests for commands (start, stop, resume, list, edit, sync, report)
   - Add unit tests for report generation and formatting
   - Add tests for EntryList operations and CSV I/O
   - Add integration tests
   - Test edge cases (overlapping entries, invalid times, etc.)

3. **Low Priority** - Sync command and synchronizers:
   - Implement `.synced` file I/O
   - Add aggregation logic
   - Complete GitHub synchroniser API calls
   - Add GitLab, Sourcehut, Linear synchronisers
   - Note: Synchronizers are not critical for current workflow

4. **Low Priority** - Documentation and polish:
   - Update user documentation
   - Add examples
   - Performance optimization

---

## Known Limitations (Same as Python)

- ❌ Daylight saving time handling
- ❌ Multi-day time entries
- ❌ Timezone switches within a day
- ❌ Time entry validation (e.g., start > stop)

---

## Build and Test

**Build:**
```bash
go build -o tt ./cmd/tt
```

**Run:**
```bash
go run ./cmd/tt --help
```

**Run tests:**
```bash
go test ./...                                      # All tests
go test -v ./internal/types/... -run TestName     # Specific test
```

**Lint:**
```bash
pre-commit run -av go-imports-repo
pre-commit run -av go-vet-repo-mod
pre-commit run -av go-staticcheck-repo-mod
# Or run all hooks:
pre-commit run --all-files
```

---

## Architecture Notes

**CSV Format:** `start,stop,type,project,taskid,customer,description`

**Directory Structure:** `~/.tracktime/YEAR/MONTH/DAY`

**Synced File Format:** `~/.tracktime/YEAR/MONTH/.synced`
```csv
type,project,taskid,synced
gitlab,acme-web,123,3.5h
```

**Auto-stop Logic:** When starting a new entry, any currently running entry is automatically stopped at the new entry's start time.

**Type Shortcuts:** `gh` → `github`, `gl` → `gitlab`

---

## Version

Current version: **v0.11.0** (as declared in `cmd/tt/main.go:28`)

---

## Summary

The Go rewrite is **~70% complete** and already usable for daily time tracking:

| Component | Completion |
|-----------|------------|
| Core library (types, config, entry list) | **100%** ✅ |
| Basic commands (start, stop, resume, list, edit) | **100%** ✅ |
| Report command (stdout output) | **85%** 🚧 (functional but needs formatting polish) |
| Report export formats (PDF/HTML/RST) | **0%** ❌ |
| Sync command | **10%** ❌ |
| Synchronizers | **5%** ❌ |
| Test coverage | **20%** (types only) ⚠️ |

**Ready for use:** Yes! All core functionality works. Report output is functional but formatting could be improved.

**Next major milestone:** Polish stdout formatting to match Python output quality, then complete export formats (PDF, HTML, RST).
